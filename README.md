Small application center separated on categories for archlinux/based distros. At this stage, it have 90 predefined applications.

The program checks whether those program exists and will display appropriate image - X not installed, Mark sign means installed. If the program is not installed by clicking X it will install it, if you click again it will remove it. There are tooltip text, just hover your mouse over the wanted application icon or it's install/remove button to see those texts in action.

I was inspired by Zorin OS and GNOME 3 to create this program.
